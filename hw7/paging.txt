# Paging
#

# In the problems below I ask you to calculate the values of
# some parameters in a virtual address space given other parameters.
# All questions are based on virtual memory with simple paging.

# Variables:
# NBA: number of bits in the virtual address
# NBO: number of bits for offset part of the virtual address
# NBP: number of bits for VPN part of the virtual address
# NP:  number of pages
# SA:  size of the virtual address space (in bytes)
# SP:  size of a virtual page (in bytes)
#
# As usual you should assume that each byte of memory has its own address.

# For example, suppose a virtual address has 32 bits, and the
# size of a page is 4 KB.  How many page bits and offset bits
# in the virtual address?
#
# Solution: Since the page size is 4 KB, the number of offset
# bits must be 12, because log2(4*1024) is 12.  Then the
# the number of page bits must be 20, since there are 32 bits
# in the virtual address, and subtracting the 12 offset bits
# we get 20.

# Think about these relationships:
#
# From the number of bits in a virtual address, you can figure out
# the number of bytes in the virtual address space, and vice versa:
#     NBA = log2(SA), or equally  SA = 2^NBA
#
# From the number of pages in the virtual address space, you can figure
# out the number of bits in the VPN part of a virtual address, and vice versa:
#     NBP = log2(NP), or equally  NP = 2^NBP
#
# From the number of bytes in a page, you can figure out the number
# of bits in the offset part of a virtual address, and vice versa:
#     NBO = log2(SP), or equally  SP = 2^NBO
#
# The number of bits in the virtual address equals the number of
# bits in the VPN part of the address plus the number of bits in
# the offset part of the address.
#     NBO + NBP = NBA
#
# For example, suppose each page is 1024 bytes.  Then
# the number of offset bits in the virtual address must be log2(1024),
# which is 10.
